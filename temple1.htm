In the village Rampura Bhankoda Chunval once upon a time one farmer was cultivating the farm. Since morning till evening he use to work on farm and get tired. In the afternoon he used to free his bullocks and took them to place called trough where they used to drink water. As this being his daily routine he suddenly saw on one day that the bullock is not drinking water from the trough. So the farmer thought that the water that comes in the trough by means of "Kosh" from the well there must be something inside it. Then farmer heared the sound and voice. Then the trough was made empty and inside that the beutiful idol of "Panch Dhatu"(accumulation of five metals) was seen that was found lying in the trough of the well. Farmer being enthusiastic he established the same idol under tree with full affection. What to do regarding this idol was the problem harrassing him. He talked about this to people and all started bowing down with full devotion. Owing to this awe of this idol happiness and peace were bestowed to him and the same thing was told to Shivabhai Satyavadi.
</p>
<p>
Shivabhai Satyavadi was at that time holding the managerial post at Gujarat Spinning Jamnadas Mill. He explained the farmer that the idol is of Ashapuran Parshvanath who is a "Jain Tirthankar" and it should be worshiped in a ceremonial way. Ashapuran Dada came to Ahmedabad with full affection and attachment giving alms to the farmer. He made the room in the mill premises and established the Lord in that room. Shivabhai and his wife experience the feeling of joy by means of worshiping and as a result the Mill started progressing.<font color="green"><i>Shree Maganlal Lalchand</i></font>  also used to meet Shivabhai in the mill with regards to the administration and knowing about this idol he also started worshipping this idol. As Shivabhai age was increasing he decided that idol should have a proper place and its ceremonial way of worshipping has to be continued further. Then at the same time <font color="green"><i>Shree Maganbhai Lalachand</i></font> met Shivabhai in the mill and demanded for the idol for Sabarmati as well as Jagabhai demanded the idol for camp Sadar bazar. The devotees of sadar bazar became aware of it and they also put their demand to shivabhai. Shree Shivabhai explained both the leaders and suggested for the permission of Ashapuran Parshvanath Dada and showed them where that chit would go owing to the righteousness the desire for Sabarmati came from Ashapuran Dada and all danced with joy. Thereafter Ashapuran Dada was brought to Sabarmati and "Shravan Sud 3" on it was established in Thakorvas. 
</p>
<p>
Graudally in Sabarmati due to the awe-inspiring personality of Ashapuran Parshvanath the population of Jains started increasing. Several reverened gurubhagwant's visits Sabarmati and finally it was decided to build a Jinalay in Sabarmati. <font color="red">Shree Manikyasinhsurishwarji Mahrajasaheb</font> decided the direction according to the direction of the pole star at 12 o'clock night and performed the "Khanan Vidhi(Bhumi Pujan)". At the time "Khanan Vidhi(Bhumi Pujan)" of the Jinalay <font color="red">Shree Manikyasinhsuriahwarji Mahrajasaheb</font> forecast that this is an auspicious occasion during "Khanan Vidhi(Bhumi Pujan)". So that here there will be about 2500 houses of Jains and they would be flourish. So he asked to establish Shree Ashapuran Parshvanath on the upper storey of Jinalay so that Sabarmati would develop so far as his eyesight would reach.There would be a village of Jains and cars will move around the village. The people of jain union(almost 25 families) were rejoiced and the feeling was expressed that his utterance would be successful. Shree Ashapuran Parshvanth dada was established in the upashraya which is nearby the Jinalay.
